# My website built with Gatsby.

Learn more about Gatsby: https://www.gatsbyjs.com/

Main features:

- Dark mode
- Simple blog with posts written in markdown
- Code highlighting for posts
- Fetch information about pinned GitHub repositories
- Styled using CSS modules and regular CSS
- Responsive design 

It is overall very minimal.

I started with the [gatsby starter blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog), which I recommend as a starting point if you are planning to build your own theme.

Feel free to use/modify this theme if you want though. However this theme is not complete yet. I am planning to add new features as needed.
